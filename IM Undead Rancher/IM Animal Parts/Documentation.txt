Please read this to understand what is capable so far with our modular animal creator!

JSON:
	The JSON file named 'parts.json' is where all parts should be stored, every animal part MUST be the same format as the
	rest and it's parameters must make sense to the animal. Also, the imagePath parameter must be the direct path
	(use the 'Copy Path' shortcut) to the corresponding image.
	
Factory:
	The whole godot project has access to the Factory singleton. This means you can access its functions and class variables
	from anywhere within the project, some of the key methods available to you are as follows:
		.getBodies() - returns a list of all the body parts available
		.getHeads() - returns a list of all the head parts available
		.getLegs() - returns a list of all the leg parts available

Animal:
	An animal consists of 3 parts, a 'AnimalHead', a 'AnimalBody' and a 'AnimalLegs'. All these parts can be directly
	referenced by using dot notation (e.g: AnimalName.head) which will provide you access to all class specific properties
	All the methods available regarding animals are as such:
		ANIMAL CLASS:
			.to_string() - Returns an articulated string describing the animal and it's parts.
			.getTotalValue() - Returns an int that totals all it's part's values
			.isHybrid() - Returns true or false based on if the animal is a hybrid or a genuine animal
		ANIMALPART CLASS:
			#All animal parts have these base methods:
			.getAnimalName() - returns a string that states the animal this part belongs to
			.getValue() - returns the value of the given part
			.getImagePath() - returns the path as a string to this part's corresponding texture
		ANIMALHEAD CLASS:
			.getNoEyes() - returns the value of how many eyes this head has
			.getNoEars() - returns the value of how many ears this head has
			.to_string() - returns an articulation of the head
		ANIMALBODY CLASS:
			.getSize() - returns the value of the size of this body part
			.to_string() - returns an articulation of the body
		ANIMALLEGS CLASS:
			.getSpeed() - returns the value of the speed of these legs
			.getFeetType() - returns the string value of what feet these legs have
			.to_string() - returns an articulation of the legs
		
WHEN YOU GET ROUND TO CREATING PARTS THAT CAN BE SOLD/BOUGHT/FOUND MAKE USE OF THE DEFAULT BODYPART SCENE AND
RETEXTURE IT USING THE SPRITECHANGER SCRIPT METHOD: .changeTexture(STRING: NEWTEXTUREPATH),
ANY TIME YOU NEED TO DISPLAY A SPECIFIC PART ANYWHERE, USE A SPRITE NODE AND RETEXTURE IT EITHER DIRECTLY, USING THE
IMAGES OR THROUGH SCRIPT USING THE METHOD.
